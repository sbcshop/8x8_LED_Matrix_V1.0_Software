<img src ="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1217/2104/files/8x8ledmatrix_1051d9a6-13c2-4e38-bfaa-49da1bdff3e5.png?v=1675343875" />

The 8x8 LED Matrix Breakout Board is a compact, versatile solution for displaying colorful, animated patterns and characters. It features a matrix of 64 bright LEDs arranged in an 8x8 grid, capable of displaying a wide range of patterns, symbols, and characters. This breakout board is ideal for hobby projects, prototyping, and educational purposes.

The WS2812B chip, which is used in the 8x8 LED matrix board, is an intelligent control LED light source that control circuit and RGB chip are both built into a package of 5050 components. Its inner components include a signal-reshaping amplifier driving circuit and an intelligent digital port data latch. Include a precise internal oscillator and a 12V voltage programmable constant-current control component to further guarantee the consistency of the pixel point light color height.

## Features:

* Intelligent reverse connect prevention prevents harm to the IC from the power supply's reverse connection.
* The only power supply is shared by the control circuit and the LED.
* In a package of 5050 components, a control circuit and an RGB chip are combined to create a full pixel point control.
* Built-in signal reshaping circuit ensures wave-form distortion does not build up following wave reshaping to the next driver.
* Power loss reset circuit and built-in electric reset circuit.
* Each of the three basic colors(RGB)' pixels is capable of a 256 brightness display, a full 16777216 color display, and a scan frequency of at least 400Hz/s.
* A single data line of cascading port transmission signal.
* Any two points greater than 5 meters apart can communicate without an additional circuit.
* Send data at an 800Kbps rate.
* The light's hue was very reliable and economical.
